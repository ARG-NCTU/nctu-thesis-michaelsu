%  考慮使用 ieeetr (缺點 \url 有問題?)
% Set bib style
\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}

% Usage:
%   \bibliography{bib/bib1,bib/bib2, ..., bib/bibN}
%
%   DONOT remove bib/BSTcontrol.bib when using IEEEtran.bst. The reason is that
% when we cite two papers of the same (or similar) authors, IEEEtran.bst would
% replace the author names with "------". To avoid this, we use BSTControl.bib
% to set ctldash_repeated_names to 'no'.
